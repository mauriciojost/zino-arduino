# TODO
- change order of asserts in the tests
- see how to create multiple test files independent of each other
- add the segment mapping to calculate more precisely how much water will be released per shot (formula: area = 0.5 * R^2 * ((a * PI / 180) - sin a)
- remove the seconds and add the days
- let the user set the time
- calibrate the time
- better allow a list of possibilities of period: 2 per day (will be at 00h00 and 12h00), 1 per day (00h00), every 2 days (each at 00h00), every 3 days, every 4 days, ... every 30 days.
