# TODO

- Button labels are important, so add them.
- Add a less scarying physical level sensor.
- See how to make reservoir filling in easier (hole too small).

- It is not trivial that the time being set up is _current time_ and not the time at what plants will be watered
- The mode **set level** should not appear as there is nothing to configure
- There is nothing preventing the user to test two pumps
