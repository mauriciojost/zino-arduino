# TODO
- see how to create multiple test files independent of each other
- let the user set the time
- calibrate the time
- better allow a list of possibilities of period: 2 per day (will be at 00h00 and 12h00), 1 per day (00h00), every 2 days (each at 00h00), every 3 days, every 4 days, ... every 30 days.
