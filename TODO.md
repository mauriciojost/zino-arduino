# TODO

- Button labels are important, so add them.
- The pump being used is really limited in terms of power. Plus it moves when the servo rotates.
- Do not EEPROM save every time there is a set, but every time there is a switch to run mode.

# DONE

- There is nothing preventing the user to test two pumps
- Add some mechanism to display logs
- Add a less scarying physical level sensor -> a simple comb |||
- See how to make reservoir filling in easier (hole too small) -> use bigger bottle
- It is not trivial that the time being set up is _current time_ and not the time at what plants will be watered
- The mode **set level** should not appear as there is nothing to configure
